## Project Summary

As the Threadit implies, users create threads (simple posts) about a particular subject in order to discuss and interact with other interested parties. Users can also subscribe to communities to receive popular threads in their personalized home feed.

## Stakeholders

Threadit is the perfect platform for **marketing teams** to create communities surrounding their products in order to generate content to engage customers and increase excitement about their product. Threadit is a great place for **fan bases** to come together and discuss their favourite team, band, or video game. Threadit allows **students** to ask questions about certain subjects and receive answers from experts. Overall Threadit is the place to be for everyone to learn, explore and interact with others.

## Core Features
